🩺 Crohn’s Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project was carried out during my internship at NIT Warangal, under the guidance of Dr. Raju Bhukya.
It focuses on early, non-invasive prediction of Crohn’s Disease using raw 16S rRNA microbiome sequence data. By applying alignment-free k-mer encoding and advanced machine learning techniques, the project demonstrates how computational biology can aid in faster and more accurate disease detection.

🔬 Key Highlights

📂 Processed raw microbiome sequences using k-mer encoding & De Bruijn graphs

🤖 Implemented multiple machine learning models (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, Random Forest, etc.)

📊 Achieved 83% accuracy with AdaBoost – outperforming baseline models

💡 Showcased the potential of alignment-free ML approaches for Crohn’s Disease diagnostics

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset: Public microbiome repositories (NCBI, ENA)

🚀 Future Scope

Integration of multi-omics data (metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics)

Use of explainable AI for biological marker discovery

Deployment as a clinical decision support tool
