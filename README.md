🩺 Crohn’s Disease Prediction using Machine Learning



📌 Overview

This project was developed during my internship at NIT Warangal, under the guidance of Dr. Raju Bhukya.
It focuses on predicting Crohn’s Disease using raw 16S rRNA microbiome sequence data through alignment-free k-mer encoding and machine learning models. The goal is to provide a non-invasive, computational approach for early detection.

🔬 Key Features

✅ Preprocessing of raw microbiome sequences (16S rRNA)

✅ Alignment-free k-mer encoding with De Bruijn graph representation

✅ Implemented multiple Machine Learning models:

AdaBoost (Best Accuracy: 83%)

Gradient Boosting

Bagging

CNN

Voting Classifier

DenseNet, etc.

✅ Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset: Public microbiome repositories (NCBI, ENA)

📊 Results

AdaBoost Classifier achieved the highest accuracy (83%)

Ensemble models like Gradient Boosting and VotingClassifier also performed well

Demonstrated the effectiveness of alignment-free ML methods for Crohn’s Disease prediction

🚀 Future Enhancements

Integration of multi-omics datasets (metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics)

Use of explainable AI to interpret biological markers

Deployment as a real-time diagnostic tool
